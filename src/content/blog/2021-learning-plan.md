I'm a goal setter.
Every year I write down a Learning plan that outlines goals to ensure that I never plateau or let my skills become outdated.
Its these goals that help me decide what client projects to prioritize, what tools to try out at the next hackathon, or the tech I want to read and write about.

> If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.

With that, here goes my list of topics for 2021 I plan to tackle.

## GraphQL

This one has been on my radar for a long time, but there was some unreasonable hesitation on my end for a while.
The usability for the front end seems **magical**, this must mean it is an absolute nightmare to implement on the backend.
You have to plumb together a bunch of endpoints, implement a new schema with tons of resolvers. It just did not sound like a technology that I have the right use case for.
Furthermore, everytime I read about GraphQL, I read about it in context of NodeJS, but most of my professional work is done in .NET.

Luckily, I came across [HotChocolate](https://github.com/ChilliCream/hotchocolate).
In .NET we have IQueryable. Entity Framework uses IQueryable, which allows us to use tools such as LINQ. Well, in-comes HotChocolate, and with just a couple lines of plumbing code we have a GraphQL endpoint. ðŸ¤¯
Once I made that connection in my head, I had quite literally dreamed about building an API with it.

## Level up my Azure Skills

I was fortunate enough to get my hands dirty with quite some DevOps in the past.
But when it comes to small projects in NextJS or others, I always seem to fall back to services such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
Those are awesome services, but most client applications I build and deploy are hosted on Azure. This year I want to host more personal projects within Azure,
blog about Azure, and just generally become more proficient in Azures Cloud offerings.

## Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence (in Python)

Before last year, the furthest I got into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, was following a Pizza Order Chat bot tutorial using IBM Watson.
I made a little bit of headway last year by putting together a remote Physiotherapy MVP, that would give you exercise instructions and measure your rehab progress, using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)
and a Skeleton Model I found online. But really, I just put together some Lego blocks without really knowing how it works under the hood.

So here we go. I went ahead and bought [Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/).
Time to brush up on python.

## Prototyping tools

I can toss together an alright looking UI if I have to, but usually prefer getting a style guide or design that I can implement.
Saying that "I am really not the most creative person", always felt like a cheap excuse for not becoming better at design.
I think it is time to finally dive a bit into an UI prototyping tool and level up my Design skills.
I decided to go with [Framer](https://www.framer.com/). It seems to have the perfect balance of advanced tools and ease of use, and secondly,
I have used FramerMotion for Animations before and highly enjoyed it.

speaking off which...

## Animations

Scale on hover, float in on scroll, smooth expand... I can do all those very basic animations, but I want to learn to add just a little bit more âœ¨ to my projects.
I doubt I'll ever get as far as building my own custom animations in Illustrator, but creating some smooth animations, beyond a one axis transform should be very achievable.
Especially with a tool such as Framer.

## Contribute to Open Source

This is something that has bothered me personally for a long time. My day to day is very reliant on open source projects. These are often maintained by volunteers or are dependent on donations.
Meanwhile, I haven't contributed in any meaningful way.
Initially, whenever I thought I want to contribute to something, the code and the process seemed just too daunting to me. Especially on more established projects.
But just a couple weeks ago, I finally put my big boy ðŸ‘– on, gave myself the time to learn about the contributor process and created a [PR](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/pull/3393#event-4352134960) that has been merged into [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/).

## Jamstack

Newsflash, I love ReactJS. But I don't have the use for a SPA for every project. Whenever I am in need for a fast, SEO friendly, and easily developed application, I have been looking at NextJS.
I was able to try some of it is ðŸ”¥ features, such as server-rendering and static generated pages, but I think there are still many topics I can improve upon.
Furthermore, I want to give [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) another try - Which goes well with the GraphQL learning goal.

## RxJS

Finally, [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/). I am unable to have a single conversation with my friend [Adam Barett](https://twitter.com/adamlbarrett), without him fanboying about RxJS. "If you would use RxJS, this would be so much simpler...".

**React**ive Extensions Library for **J**ava**S**cript... It has React and JS in the name, you'd think I would be all over it. I understand the key concept such as Observables, Observer, and Subscriptions, but I have
never used it before. I found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUFxB23s9R4) on the topic, by Adam, that I will use to get started.

_It's on my list Adam, I hope you are happy!_ ðŸ˜‰

## How to check off topics

Great! We have a list of topics we want to tackle throughout the year! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

But what does **done** mean when it comes to learning a new topic?
For me, **done** means that I understand the topic enough that I can articulate its use cases, pros, and cons.
I should be able to take what I have learned and have an engaged discussion about it with an expert.

What are some ways that help you to keep yourself accountable and prioritize your learning? Do you have a learning list? Share it in the comments!
